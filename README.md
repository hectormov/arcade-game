Arcade Game
===============================

This is a project for the Front End Web Developer Nano Degree (FEND) from Udacity.
The goal of the project is to use object oriented programming, the game engine was provided by Udacity.
Most of the changes done by me is the app.js and styling, very little changes were made to the index.html (to add anything other than the game) and also very little changes to engine.js


How to Play
==============================

The game loads automatically, all you have to do is start playing right away.

The difficulty will increase as you pass each level but it will decrease every time you lose.

To pass a level you have to use the arrows of the keyboard to get your player to the water, then just start again

The game is reset every time you pass a level or you are hit by an enemy.
